### [Brew Keeper][brew-keeper-gh]

**Web app to _create_, _brew_, _refine_, _store notes on_, and _share_ coffee recipes. (Final Project)**  

Each student at The Iron Yard was required to pitch a final project idea, and I had been having difficulty coming up with one that was feasible. Although I came up with this project at 3:30&nbsp;a.m. on pitch day, I was very excited about the idea and was thrilled when we started working on it less than 12 hours later.  

**Project Details**  
**Time:** 20 days  
**Collaborators:** Shay Hall (FEE), David White (FEE), and Kathleen Rauh (Python)  
**Python Tools that I Used:** Django, Django REST API framework, PostgreSQL, Heroku, Travis-CI, DRF Nested Routers, Django CORS Headers, Mailgun  
**Full Site:** [www.brew-keeper.com](www.brew-keeper.com)  
**API Wiki:** [Development Notes][brew-keeer-dn]

### [URLy Bird][urly-bird-gh]

**Web app with URL-shortening functionality.**  

We worked very quickly and had most of "normal mode" covered by Saturday, so were able to focus on polishing up the layout and bootstrap implementation. I am proud of how nice this ended up looking.  

**Project Details**  
**Time:** 3.5 days  
**Collaborator:** Tyler Kotkin (Python)  
**Python Tools that I Used:** Django, PostgreSQL, Bootstrap 3, Heroku

### [American Time Use Survey Analysis][atus-gh]

### [Ultimate Pig][ultimate-pig-gh]

**IPython Notebook containing analysis of the dice game "pig."**  


Pig is a form of solitaire in which the player has 7 rounds to roll a single die one or more times, adding the results as they go; however, a round's score is 0 if they roll a 1.  

The goal of this assignment was to use a Monte Carlo simulation to determine the strategy for scoring the highest possible points. What I liked about this assignment was the unexpected shape of the resulting graphs, the meaning of which I was later able to understand.

**Project Details**  
**Time:** 1 day  
**Python Tools that I Used:** random, math, statistics, Matplotlib, IPython Notebook  
**IPython Notebook:** [Ultimate Pig ipynb][ultimate-pig-ipynb]
