Below are 5 more of the <a href="https://github.com/tiyd-python-2015-08/assigments/tree/fee-collab" >28 projects</a> that I worked on as part of my Python Engineering class at The Iron Yard, Durham. Each title links to the associated GitHub repository.

<h2 class="invertwide" id="american-time-use-survey-analysisatus-gh"><a href="https://github.com/ahartz1/atus-analysis">American Time Use Survey Analysis</a></h2>

<p><strong>IPython Notebook containing analysis of the <a href="http://www.bls.gov/tus/home.htm#data">American Time Use Survey data</a>.</strong>  </p>

<p>This assignment was largely unguided, with the aim of exploring an unknown data source for ourselves. Getting my initial bearings was a challenge, as there were many files and a huge number of data points (not to mention the coded field names!). I focused on normal activities to ensure the data set was large enough to have relevance.  </p>

<p><strong>Project Details</strong><br />
<strong>Time:</strong> 3.5 days<br />
<strong>Python Tools:</strong> pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, IPython Notebook, datetime<br />
<strong>IPython Notebook:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/ahartz1/atus-analysis/blob/master/atus-analysis.ipynb">ATUS ipynb</a>  </p>

<h2 class="invertwide" id="programming-language-classifierpl-classifier-gh"><a href="https://github.com/ahartz1/programming-language-classifier">Programming Language Classifier</a></h2>

<p><strong>IPython Notebook loading and executing custom featurizers.</strong>  </p>

<p>The challenge of this assignment was two-fold: (1) collect and access a corpus of snippets of programming languages and (2) use Scikit-Learn tools to classify the test snippets as accurately as possible. I manually built extensive featurizers and accompanying tests to be used with the <code>DecisionTreeClassifier</code> because the Naive Bayes classifier gave poor results for my data set.</p>

<strong>Time:</strong> 3.5 days<br />
<strong>Python Tools:</strong> sklearn, nose, Matplotlib, IPython Notebook<br />
<strong>IPython Notebook:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/ahartz1/programming-language-classifier/blob/master/programming-language-classifier.ipynb">Programming Language Classifier ipynb</a></p>

<h2 class="invertwide" id="road-rageroad-rage-gh"><a href="https://github.com/ahartz1/road-rage">Road Rage</a></h2>

<p><strong>IPython Notebook presenting traffic simulation.</strong>  </p>

<p>The goal of this assignment was to use a Monte Carlo simulation to determine the ideal speed limit for a 1 km stretch of road. I put a lot of effort into a version of hard mode that, although working, needed just a bit more troubleshooting.</p>

<strong>Time:</strong> 3.5 days<br />
<strong>Python Tools:</strong> random, math, NumPy, Matplotlib, IPython Notebook<br />
<strong>IPython Notebook:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/ahartz1/road-rage/blob/master/road-rage.ipynb">Road Rage ipynb</a></p>

<h2 class="invertwide" id="what-to-watchwhat-to-watch-gh"><a href="https://github.com/ahartz1/what-to-watch">What to Watch</a></h2>

<p><strong>Command-line program to provide meaningful access to data in the MovieLens 100k database.</strong>  </p>

<p>The purpose of this project was to make effective use of classes, list comprehensions, the <code>csv</code> module to read in data. I built a Django app later in the class that has similar functionality for the MovieLens 1M data set.  </p>

<strong>Time:</strong> 3.5 days<br />
<strong>Python Tools:</strong> csv, math, os, sys  </p>

<h2 class="invertwide" id="mystery-word--evil-mystery-wordmystery-word-gh"><a href="https://github.com/ahartz1/mystery-word">Mystery Word / Evil Mystery Word</a></h2>

<p><strong>Command-line “hangman”-style game.</strong>  </p>

<p>This was the very first weekend project and was a lot of fun to put together. I was able to finish the normal mode on Saturday afternoon, so was able to fully tackle the “Evil” version of the game—just try to beat it!</p>

<strong>Time:</strong> 3.5 days<br />
<strong>Python Tools:</strong> deepcopy, os, random, unittest</p>
